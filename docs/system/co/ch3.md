# Arthimetic for Computer

## Intrduction

- Computer words are composed of bits
    - thus words can be represented as binary numbers
    - there are 32bit/word or 64bits/word in RISC-V
    - Contains four bytes or eight bytes
- Generic Implementation
    - use the PC to supply instruction address
    - get the insturction from memory
    - read registers
    - use the instruction to decide exactly what to do
