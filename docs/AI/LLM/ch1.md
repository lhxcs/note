# Understanding Large Language Models

!!! note "Goal"

    understanding LLMs by implementing a ChatGPT-like LLM based on the transformer architecture.

## What is an LLM?

An LLM is a neural network designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-like text.


## Stages of building and using LLMs

- When it comes to modeling performance, custom-built LLMs (those tailored for specific tasks or domains) can outperform general-purpose LLMs.
- The general process of creating LLM includes pretraining and finetuning.
    - pretraining: the initial phase where a model like an LLM is trained on a large diverse dataset to develop a broad understanding of language.
    - finetuning: the pretrained model serve as a foundational resource that can be further refined. finetuning is a process where the model is specifically trained on a narrower dataset that is more specific to particular tasks.
