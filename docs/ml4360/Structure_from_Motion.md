# Preliminaries
## Camera Calibration
- Camera calibration is the process of finding the **intrinsic/extrinsic** parameters
	- First, the known calibration target is *captured in different poses*
	- Second, features on the target are detected in the images
	- Finally,the camera intrinsics and extrinsics are jointly optimized.
## Feature Detection and Description
- Point features describe the appearance of **local,salient regions**in an image
- They can be used to describe and match images taken from different viewpoints.

## Triangulation

# Factorization

# Quesitons?
- I could not fully understand SIFT algorithm
