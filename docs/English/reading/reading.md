### The Actor and the Audience(Official 66)

- crumble 崩溃，弄碎

The actor who has been brilliant in rehearsal can crumble before an audience.

An actor who seemed fairly unexciting at rehearsal can suddenly **take fire and dazzle** the audience with unexpected energy.

- soberly 冷静地，严肃地，朴素地

Opening night **recklessness** is viewed as a sure sign of the amateur, who relies primarily on **guts** and **adrenaline** to get through the performance.

- recklessness: 鲁莽，轻率，不顾后果
- guts: 胃，adrenaline:肾上腺素

- veteran: 老兵，退伍军人，经验丰富的人
- crest: 顶峰，到达山顶

The veteran actor can determine quickly how to **ride the crest of audience laughter** and how to hold the line just long enough that it will pierce the lingering chuckles but not to be overridden by them.
