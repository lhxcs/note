**What is 'Bigorexia'?**

For many boys and young men, muscle worship has become practically a digital **rite of passage** in today's **beefcake-saturated** culture.

- rite of passage: 成人仪式
- beefcake-saturated: 满是健美男子的  saturate 饱和，充斥
- mesomorphic: 体育型体质 a person whose natural body shape is neither thin nor fat, with quite a lot of muscle.   mesomorphic superheros
- top grossing 票房收入最高
- adulation: 吹捧，奉承 the online adulation of muscular male bodies can have a toxic effect on the self-esteem of young men, with never-ending scroll of six packs and boy-band faces.

We know there is a ton of pressure on guys, but disordered behaviors that fall specifically on the more muscular end of the spectrum tend to get a pass publicly, since goal-oriented habits around the gym are socially accepted, glamorized even.
